# Introduction

Welcome to the reference documentation for the [Jolie programming language](https://jolie-lang.org).

![](./.gitbook/assets/jolielogo.png)

Jolie is a _microservice-oriented programming language_: it brings a structured linguistic approach to the programming of services, including constructs for access endpoints \([communication ports](./basics/communication-ports/)\), APIs with synchronous and asynchronous operations \([interfaces](./basics/interfaces/)\), [communications](./basics/communication-ports/using_communication_ports.md), behavioural workflows \(including a native [parallel operator](./basics/composing_statements.md)\), and multiparty sessions \([correlation sets](./basics/sessions.md)\).
Additionally, Jolie embraces that microservice systems are often heterogeneous and interoperability should be a first-class citizen: all data in Jolie is structured as trees that can be semi-automatically (most of the time fully automatically) converted from/to different data formats (JSON, XML, etc.) and communicated over a variety of protocols (HTTP, binary protocols, etc.).
Jolie is an attempt at making the _first language for microservices_, in the sense that it provides primitives to deal directly with the programming of common concerns regarding microservices without relying on frameworks or external libraries.
Our aim is to provide a tool that aid developers in producing and managing microservice systems more effectively.
