# The Jolie Documentation repository

This repository manages the Jolie documentation at <https://docs.jolie-lang.org/>.

If you want to update the documentation, **this is not the repository that you are looking for**. You have to update the branch of this repository for the relevant version of Jolie, e.g., for Jolie versions `1.10.x`, you have to update the branch `v1.10.x`.
