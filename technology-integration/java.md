# Java
Since the current interpreter of Jolie is written in Java, Java is a programming language which can be easily integrated in a Jolie program.
In the following sections we discuss all the different possibilities to integrate Java and Jolie together:
* **jolie2java**: transforming Jolie interfaces into Java classes
* **Javaservices**: writing Java classes to be used as functional supports for Jolie services
* **Java clients for Jolie services**: calling a Jolie service from a Java-based application
