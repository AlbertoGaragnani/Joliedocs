# Embedding

Embedding is a mechanism for executing multiple services within the same execution context. A service, called _embedder_, can _embed_ another service, called _embedded_ service, by targeting it with the `embedded` primitive.

The syntax for embedding is:

```text

embedded {
    Language : path [ in OutputPort ]
}
```

the embedding construct specifies the type \(`Language`\) of the service to embed, and `path` is a URL \(possible in simple form\) pointing to the definition of the service to embed. Jolie currently supports the embedding of services written with the following technologies: 

* `Jolie`;
* `Java`;
* `JavaScript`.

Embedding may optionally specify an output port: in this case, as soon as the service is loaded and in case there is no location defined, the output port is bound to the _"local"_ communication input port of the embedded service. 

Embedding produces a hierarchy of services where the embedder is the parent service of embedded ones; this hierarchy handles termination: whenever a service terminates, all its embedded services are recursively terminated. The hierarchy is also useful for enhancing performances: services in the same virtual machines indeed, may communicate using fast local memory communication channels.

Command line parameters can also be passed within the embedding path.
