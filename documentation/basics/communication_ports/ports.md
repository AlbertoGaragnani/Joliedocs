```
## Ports
```

```

Let us recall the concepts of *input ports* and *output ports* seen in the [Behaviour and Deployment](/documentation/getting_started/behavior_and_deployment.html) section. There are two kinds of ports: *input ports*, which expose input operations to other services, and *output ports*, defining how to invoke the operations of other services.

*Location*, *protocol* and *interface* are the three elements in the definition of ports. 
Location and protocol define the concrete binding information between a Jolie program and other service, interfaces specify type information expected to be satisfied by the behaviour that uses the port.
