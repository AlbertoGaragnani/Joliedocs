## Communication Ports

Communication ports constitute the deployment part of a Jolie program. 
They define the communication links used by services to exchange data.

The basic deployment primitives are input ports and output ports, which support input and output communications with other services. 
[Ports](communication_ports/ports.md) are based on [interfaces](communication_ports/interfaces) and [data types](communication_ports/data_types).

The deployment part of a Jolie program is a list of *deployment instructions* among which we can have *input* and *output* *ports*, *interfaces*, and *data type* definitions.
