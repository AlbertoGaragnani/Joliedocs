# Introduction

Communication ports define how communications with other microservices are supported. There are two kinds of [ports](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/communication_ports/ports.md). Input ports deal with exposing input operations to other microservices. Output ports define how to invoke the operations of other microservices. Ports allow Jolie programmers to combine communication media \([sockets](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/locations/socket.md), [localsockets](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/locations/localsockets.md), [bluetooth](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/locations/bluetooth.md)\) and data formats \([http](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/protocols/http.md), [https](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/protocols/https.md), [soap](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/protocols/soap.md)\), which is the concrete binding information between the communicating microservices.

In addition to the concrete binding, Jolie ports include [interfaces](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/communication_ports/interfaces.md) to express [data type](https://github.com/jolielang/docs/tree/de0bcc5b82206ed6be6cb78fa10f6068bbe5881c/documentation/basics/communication_ports/communication_ports/data_types.md) information for each operation supported by a given port.
