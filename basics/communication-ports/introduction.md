# Introduction

Communication ports define how communications with other microservices are supported. There are two kinds of [ports](/docs/communication_ports/ports). Input ports deal with exposing input operations to other microservices. Output ports define how to invoke the operations of other microservices. Ports allow Jolie programmers to combine communication media \([sockets](/docs/basics/locations/socket), [localsockets](/docs/locations/localsockets), [bluetooth](/docs/locations/bluetooth)\) and data formats \([http](/docs/protocols/http), [https](/docs/protocols/https), [soap](/docs/protocols/soap)\), which is the concrete binding information between the communicating microservices.

In addition to the concrete binding, Jolie ports include [interfaces](/docs/basics/communication_ports/interfaces) to express [data type](/docs/basics/communication_ports/data_types) information for each operation supported by a given port.
