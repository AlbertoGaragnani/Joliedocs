# Introduction

Communication ports define how communications with other microservices are supported. There are two kinds of [ports](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/basics/communication-ports/ports). Input ports deal with exposing input operations to other microservices. Output ports define how to invoke the operations of other microservices. Ports allow Jolie programmers to combine communication media \([sockets](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/locations/socket), [localsockets](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/locations/localsocket), [bluetooth](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/locations/btl2cap)\) and data formats \([http](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/protocols/http), [https](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/protocols/https), [soap](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/protocols/soap)\), which is the concrete binding information between the communicating microservices. Communication ports define how communications with other microservices are supported. There are two kinds of [ports](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/basics/communication-ports/ports).

In addition to the concrete binding, Jolie ports include [interfaces](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/basics/communication-ports/interfaces) to express [data type](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/basics/communication-ports/data_types) information for each operation supported by a given port.
