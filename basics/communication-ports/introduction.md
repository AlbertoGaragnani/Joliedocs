# Introduction

Communication ports define how communications with other microservices are supported. There are two kinds of [ports](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/communication_ports/ports/README.md). Input ports deal with exposing input operations to other microservices. Output ports define how to invoke the operations of other microservices. Ports allow Jolie programmers to combine communication media \([sockets](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/locations/socket/README.md), [localsockets](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/locations/localsockets/README.md), [bluetooth](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/locations/bluetooth/README.md)\) and data formats \([http](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/protocols/http/README.md), [https](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/protocols/https/README.md), [soap](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/protocols/soap/README.md)\), which is the concrete binding information between the communicating microservices. Communication ports define how communications with other microservices are supported. There are two kinds of [ports](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/basics/communication_ports/ports/README.md).

In addition to the concrete binding, Jolie ports include [interfaces](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/basics/communication_ports/interfaces/README.md) to express [data type](https://github.com/jolie/docs/tree/84c930e5e019035d1ee74b0ec1a9a31f2f8dddbb/basics/basics/communication_ports/data_types/README.md) information for each operation supported by a given port.
