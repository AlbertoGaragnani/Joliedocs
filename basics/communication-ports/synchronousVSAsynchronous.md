# Synchronous vs Asynchronous communications
Input and output primitives allows for the programming of both synchronous and asynchronous communications. Synchronous communication always deal with a message exchange between the sender and the receiver where the sender is blocked until the reply is received. Asynchronous communication deal with a single message exchange where the sender can continue to work after sending the message. The two communication patterns can be summarized in the following diagram:



Such a definition has some implications 


It is worth noting that both of them have always an impact on the architecture of the system.
