# Jolie definitions

We present the Jolie interpretation of some fundamental concepts behind programming microservices, like those of _service_ and _interface_.

## Operations (or API)
Qui si mette il paragone con le API. Two types:
* Synchronous
* Asynchronous

## Interfaces 
An Interface is a machine-readable and -checkable declaration of a set of operations. An interface acts as the contract between a service and its clients.

## Ports
Ports are endpoints used for sending and receiving messages. There are two kind of ports: _input ports_ and _output ports_. The former are used for receiving messages the latter for sending messages. An input port must define how it can be accessed (e.g., by accepting connections on a TCP port), the transport protocol that it uses (e.g., HTTP), and the _interface_ that it exposes (which concretely defines the data types and available operations of the exposed API). Likewise, a service can invoke another service by means of _output ports_ with a compatible configuration.

## Behaviours
A _behaviour_ defines the logic to execute when a message is received by a service. A behaviour can perform computation using the received data and/or send messages to other services. 

In Jolie the behaviour is expressed in the _main_ code block. A behaviour can define different operations, and different logics can be attached to different operations. Behaviours are executed by _processes_.

## Sessions

## Services

The _service_ is the unit of reusable software in Jolie. All components are services.

Services communicate with each other by exchanging messages. That is the only way that they have for exchanging data with each other. Service share no memory, although shared memory is sometimes used under the hood by Jolie to optimise some message exchanges (for example by using shared memory channels among services living in the same execution context.
