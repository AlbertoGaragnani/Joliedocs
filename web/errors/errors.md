# Understandig errors

This section is devoted to explain some errors that can be raised by the interpreter which could be difficut to understand due to the service oriented model used by Jolie:

- __The first statement of the main procedure must be an input if the execution mode is not single__ : In Jolie a service may have different [execution modalities](https://docs.jolie-lang.org/v1.10.x/language-tools-and-standard-library/basics/processes.html): `concurrent`, `sequential` and `single`. If no execution modaltiies are specified, `single` is used by default. If the execution modality is `single` the service will be executed once, it is suitable for creating scripts. If it is set to `concurrent` or `sequential`, the service will start to listen for requests to be served. In this last case, the behaviour defined within scope `main` must always start with an [input primitive](https://docs.jolie-lang.org/v1.10.x/language-tools-and-standard-library/basics/communication-ports/using_communication_ports.html) or a choice among them obtained with an [input choice](https://docs.jolie-lang.org/v1.10.x/language-tools-and-standard-library/basics/composing_statements.html#input-choice). An input primitive can be a request-response or a one-way. In all other cases, the engine will raise the error `The first statement of the main procedure must be an input if the execution mode is not single`. So if you get this error after running a jolie service, check your scope `main` and verify if there are some statements at the top level that are not input primitives or an input choice.
