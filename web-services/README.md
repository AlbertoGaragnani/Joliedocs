# Web Services
Web Services represent a special category of services. They are characterized by the usage of a set of specific XML based technologies like WSDL and SOAP. A Jolie service can both invoke existing web services and being exposed as a Web Service. It is very easy to do so, it is sufficient to parameterized a Jolie port (input or output) to use the protocol [soap](../protocols/soap.md) or the protocol soaps.
